# JWT Auth

This repository is an independent auth component for your backend.

**Briefly about:** JWT *access* and *refresh* tokens, PostgreSQL as storage.

## Overview
The component provides full *JWT* auth including this features:
- Basic email-password auth logic
- Account creation confirmation via email
- Cookie management logic to provide invisible session control

## Setting up
1. Set up your *npm* project using `npm init`
2. Clone this repository to your project using `git clone` or any other convenient method.
3. Install required **npm** dependencies
    - bcryptjs
    - cookie-parser
    - cors
    - dotenv
    - express
    - express-validator
    - jsonwebtoken
    - nodemailer
    - nodemon _(for dev regime)_
    - pg
    - uuid
4. Create `.env` file in root directory of your project. 
5. Fill the `.env` properties
    > If you don't know how to set _environment_ properties just google it! :upside_down_face:
   
    - `API_URL`=your_api_url (https://localhost:8000 as example)
    - `CLIENT_URL`=your_frontend_url (such as `API_URL`)
    - `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`=Y0ur_$ecRET_keY_F0R_jWt_@cce$$_t0KeN
    - `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`=$uCh_@$_axe$_bUT_4_ReFresh
    - `PG_USER`=your_postgres_user
    - `PG_PASSWORD`=your_postgres_password
    - `PG_HOST`=your_postgres_host (_localhost_ in my case)
    - `PG_PORT`=your_postgres_port (default port for postgres is 5432)
    - `PORT`=your_server_port (8000 as example)
5. _(Optional)_ set up a terminal command to run server in **dev** regime
    
    Open **package.json** in the root directory of your project.
    
    Find the **scripts** block and add `"dev": "nodemon index.js"` into it.
    
    Save the file.
6. Run **index.js** using `node index.js` or `npm run dev`

## How can you improve this component in your project?
Unlikely for this component it cannot be applied for all projects as it is here.

But you can perform neccessary updates with minimal efforts like
    - make the `tokens` table store IPs & devices for better security and user experience
    - configure JWT payloads for _access_ & _refresh_ tokens (add roles as example)
    - And of course, add more routes!
